# ðŸ“˜ Ontology Guidance

Follow this guide to navigate through the various ontology files within the project repository.

## ðŸ“‚ Accessing Ontology Files

To begin working with the ontology files, please ensure you are in the correct directory within the repository.

1. Navigate to the ontology directory by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   cd csonto/target/csonto/src/ontology/
   ```

2. Within this directory, you will find several files named `csonto-edit`. You can open any of these files using Protege to view or modify the ontology.

## ðŸ›  Scripts for Ontology Manipulation

If you need to work with scripts related to the ontology, follow these steps:

1. If you're already in the ontology directory, navigate to the scripts directory by executing:
   ```bash
   cd csonto/target/csonto/src/scripts/
   ```

2. **StatusChecker Script:** This script is responsible for checking the status of various policies within the ontology.

3. **OntologyBuilder Script:** This script aids in building and evolving the ontology throughout the development process.

4. **Onto_Definitions & Updates Script:** Use this script for defining and updating instances within the ontology.
